## The task
During the experiment, we asked participants (ages 18 to 25 years old) to complete a memory maze (what we called "double Y maze") where people first identify the target image and navigate through sequences of images to try to get back to the target image. There are two decision points that in the navigations: the participants need to get both decisions correct, which means the correct navigation route to receive a reward(a screen showing correct); If the participants successfully navigate back to the target but through the wrong route, there will be no reward but the screen will show "wrong route"; If the participants did not navigate back to the original target image, the screen will display "incorrect" as a punishment.
